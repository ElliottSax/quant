## ⚠️ Critical Decisions Explained

### Why Next.js (not Streamlit)?

| Requirement | Streamlit | Next.js |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| SEO | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent |
| Mobile | ❌ Mediocre | ✅ Great |
| Viral features | ❌ Hard | ✅ Easy |
| Scale (10K users) | ⚠️ Struggles | ✅ Built for it |

**Decision:** We need organic growth through SEO. Next.js is correct choice.

---

### Why Options Are Critical?

**Stock Trade:**
- Buy $50K stock
- 1x leverage
- Low time sensitivity
- Medium suspicion

**Options Trade:**
- Buy $50K options
- 10-100x leverage
- EXTREME time sensitivity (theta decay)
- Very high suspicion (especially if short expiry)

**Viral Potential:**
- "Senator made 847% on options" > "Senator made 15% on stocks"
- Options = 10x more engaging content
- Options = differentiation from competitors

**Decision:** Options are MUST HAVE for MVP, not Phase 2.

---

### Why Freemium from Day 1 (not 6 months free)?

**6 Months Free (V1):**
- Burn $8,000 with $0 revenue
- No validation of willingness to pay
- Break-even Month 18-24
- High risk

**Freemium Day 1 (V2):**
- Early revenue validation
- Fund infrastructure costs
- Break-even Month 10
- Still 95% free (marketing benefit)

**Decision:** Validate monetization early, but keep core free.

---

### Why 6 Months (not 8 weeks)?

**8 Weeks (V1 claimed):**
- Build government tracker
- Build 4 ML models (SARIMA, DTW, CNN, RBM)
- Build transformers, GNN, LSTM
- Build sentiment pipeline
- Build full frontend
- **Impossible**

**6 Months (V2):**
- Build government tracker ONLY
- Add options support (same data source)
- Polish, test, launch
- **Achievable**

**Decision:** Focus wins. Ship something valuable, not everything mediocre.
