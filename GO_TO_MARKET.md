Free platform → [link]

Example: Did Nancy Pelosi beat the market in 2024?

Return: 28.3%
S&P 500: 24.1%
P-value: 0.087 (not statistically significant at α=0.05)

We show the math. 🧮"
```

**Content Mix:**
- 40% Trade highlights
- 30% Statistical insights
- 20% Engagement (polls, questions)
- 10% Platform updates

**Daily Posting Schedule:**
- 8 AM: Market open commentary
- 12 PM: Interesting finding
- 4 PM: After-hours update
- 8 PM: Engagement post

**Thread Examples:**

**Example 1: Trade Breakdown**
```
1/ Nancy Pelosi just disclosed a $500K+ buy of $NVDA.

Let's analyze the timing 🧵

2/ Trade date: [date]
Disclosure date: [date] (45 days later)

This is legal under the STOCK Act, which allows up to 45 days.

3/ At time of trade:
- $NVDA price: $XXX
- S&P 500: X,XXX

Today:
- $NVDA: $YYY (+Z%)
- S&P 500: Y,YYY (+W%)

4/ But did she beat the market?

Return: Z%
Market: W%
Difference: X%

Statistical significance: p = 0.XX
[Interpretation]

5/ Timing analysis:
- Days to earnings: XX
- Days to major news: XX
- Timing score: XX/100

[Interpretation]

6/ See full analysis: [link]

Track all Congress trades: [link]

What trade should we analyze next?
```

**Example 2: Statistical Education**
```
1/ Most "X politician beat the market!" headlines are statistically meaningless.

Here's why 🧵

2/ If 535 people flip coins, some will get lucky.

Same with trading.

You need statistical tests to separate skill from luck.

3/ The test: "Is this performance significantly different from random chance?"

We use t-tests with α=0.05 (95% confidence)

4/ Example:
Politician returns: 15%
Market returns: 10%

Looks good! But...

5/ Sample size: 5 trades
Standard deviation: 12%

T-statistic: 0.74
P-value: 0.48

Result: Not statistically significant.

Could be luck.

6/ Always ask:
- Sample size?
- Statistical significance?
- Adjustment for multiple testing?

We show all of this: [link]
```

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Weekly poll: "Which politician should we analyze next?"
- Ask followers for interesting patterns
- Respond to every mention
- Quote tweet with analysis
- Tag politicians (tastefully)

**Growth Target:**
- Month 1: 500 followers
- Month 3: 2,000 followers
- Month 6: 5,000 followers
- Month 12: 15,000 followers

### Reddit Strategy

**Engagement Approach:**
- DON'T self-promote
- DO contribute valuable insights
- Post interesting findings, not links
- Mention tool organically in comments

**Subreddits:**
- r/wallstreetbets - Controversial findings
- r/stocks - Serious analysis
- r/investing - Educational content
- r/dataisbeautiful - Visualizations
- r/options - Options-related trades
- r/algotrading - Methodology discussions

**Post Examples:**

**r/dataisbeautiful:**
```
Title: "[OC] Congressional Stock Trading Performance vs S&P 500 (2024)"

[Beautiful chart showing distribution]

Tools: Python, Matplotlib, PostgreSQL
Data: House and Senate financial disclosures

Interesting findings:
- 12.5% significantly beat market (p<0.05)
- Tech stocks over-represented
- Average disclosure delay: 37 days
```

**r/stocks:**
```
Title: "Analysis: Which sectors are Congress trading most?"

I analyzed 1,000 Congressional stock trades from 2024.

Top sectors:
1. Technology (42%)
2. Healthcare (18%)
3. Finance (15%)

For context, S&P 500 sector weights:
1. Technology (28%)
2. Healthcare (13%)
3. Finance (12%)

Congress is significantly overweight tech.

Statistical test: χ² = 47.3, p < 0.001

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Profile Positioning:**
- "Quantitative Analyst | Built [Platform Name]"
- Professional, data-driven approach
- Target audience: Finance professionals, quant students

**Content:**
- Weekly long-form posts
- Focus on methodology
- Professional tone
- Data visualizations

**Post Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
The problem with most "politician X beat the market" articles?

No statistical rigor.

I built a platform to fix this. Here's what I learned:

1. Sample size matters
Most politicians have <20 trades. Too small for significance.

2. Publication bias
Media only reports winners. What about the losers?

3. Multiple hypothesis testing
Test 535 people, some will beat market by luck.

We address all of these with:
- Minimum sample size (n=10)
- Track all politicians (not just winners)
- Bonferroni correction for multiple testing

Results: Only 12.5% of Congress significantly beat market in 2024.
